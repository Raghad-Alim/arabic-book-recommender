    "we will decode the Categories  to use catboost in its full limits,because after a search we did we found out that CatBoost might misinterpret the binary-encoded values as having ordinal relationships and it will treat them as numerical features rather than categorical features. which means CatBoost won’t apply its specialized handling for categorical data (e.g., Ordered Target Encoding), which could reduce model performance.Also we have merged the title and categories to provide more data to the model and increase it's accuracy"

    "**Justification for Choosing CatBoost**\n",
    "\n",
    "CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm specifically designed to handle categorical and structured data efficiently. Since book categorization involves predicting a categorical output (genre) from text and structured data, CatBoost is a strong choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key reasons for selecting CatBoost:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Handles Categorical Features Without Extensive Preprocessing: Unlike traditional boosting models (e.g., XGBoost), CatBoost can process categorical data directly without requiring one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.Works Well with Arabic Text: Since CatBoost supports non-English text processing, it is suitable for this Arabic dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.Uses Structured Data Alongside Text: CatBoost can incorporate both structured data (such as author, publisher, price) and text-based        features (like book descriptions). This allows the model to leverage a more comprehensive set of information, improving its ability to       make predictions based on a richer dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4.Regularization Reduces Overfitting: Techniques such as ordered boosting help prevent the model from memorizing the dataset rather than       learning meaningful patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference for CatBoost**\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed explanation of CatBoost and its applications is available in the official documentation:\n",
    "  Dorogush, A. V., Jr., Ershov, V., Gulin, A., & Yandex. (2018). CatBoost: gradient boosting with categorical features [Journal-article]. arXiv. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11363v1 (Original work published 2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper presents the theoretical framework of CatBoost, its advantages over traditional boosting methods, and its success in classification tasks.\n",
